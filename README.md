## About

I'm a Master’s student in Computer Science, building at the intersection of software engineering, data systems, and machine learning.

☕ Turning coffee into software, ML models, and scalable data pipelines.  
🚀 Interested in distributed systems, applied ML, and production-grade engineering.  
🧠 Currently exploring deep learning, large-scale data processing, and cloud-native systems.  
🔧 I enjoy building backend systems, analytics platforms, and ML-powered applications.  
📊 Always curious about how data can drive better engineering decisions.  

Feel free to explore my projects — and let’s build something cool.
